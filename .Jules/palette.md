## 2024-05-23 - Icon Consistency in File Explorer

**Learning:** Users find it jarring when mix-and-match emojis are used alongside professional UI icons. Replacing the confusing "Calendar" emoji (📅) for "Grid View" with a standard Grid icon immediately clarifies the function.
**Action:** Always audit UI controls for icon consistency. Avoid using emojis for permanent UI elements unless it's a specific stylistic choice for the entire app.
