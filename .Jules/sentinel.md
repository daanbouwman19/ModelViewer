## 2024-05-23 - IPC Authorization Checks

**Vulnerability:** Several IPC handlers (`record-media-view`, `get-media-view-counts`, `db:upsert-metadata`, etc.) accepted arbitrary file paths from the renderer without validating that they belonged to configured media directories. This could allow a compromised renderer process to probe for file existence (via timing side-channels or error messages) or potentially trigger NTLM hash leaks on Windows by accessing UNC paths.
**Learning:** IPC handlers in Electron are trusted entry points but often lack the same middleware/validation layers as HTTP servers. It's easy to assume "the renderer is my code", but in a defense-in-depth model (or if XSS occurs), the renderer should be treated as untrusted.
**Prevention:** Always validate file paths in IPC handlers using `authorizeFilePath` (or equivalent) before performing any file system operations or database writes involving those paths. Ensure consistent validation logic between the HTTP server and Electron IPC.
